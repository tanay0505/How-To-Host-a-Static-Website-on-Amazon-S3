# How-To-Host-a-Static-Website-on-Amazon-S3
 Websites are run by pictures and files. You'll be hosting (which basically means make public on the Internet) a website on Amazon S3 by uploading website content into S3 and then making it publicly accessible.


🚀 Just wrapped up a thrilling Amazon S3 project—challenge mode engaged! 🔍

In this project, I:

✅ Created and configured an Amazon S3 bucket, complete with ACLs, versioning, and public access.

✅ Uploaded website content, diving deep into how static websites function and how to host them on S3.

✅ Tackled public access settings and fixed an interesting challenge with the website's visibility.


📸 See my journey from creating buckets to deploying a fully functional static website in my documentation below.

📢 Shoutout to all AWS learners—let's connect, share tips, and keep improving!

🙏 Big thanks to **NextWork** for setting up this engaging challenge. 

Ready for the next one! **community.nextwork.org**
